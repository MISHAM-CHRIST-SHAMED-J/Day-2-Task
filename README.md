Differences between Document and Window Objects

Document Object: The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.

Syntax:
document.property_name;

Properties of document:

activeElement: It returns the currently active elements in the document.
body: It returns the contents of the body element.
anchors: It returns all <a> elements that have a name attribute.
cookie: It returns the cookie of the current document.
domain: It returns the domain name of the document server.
URL: It returns the complete URL of the document.
forms: It returns all the elements of the form.
title: It returns the title element of the document.
head: It returns the head element of the document.
links: It returns all <area> and <a> elements that have a href attribute.
images: It returns the collection of <img> elements in the document.
scripts: It returns all script elements present in the document.

Example: This example describes the implementation of the document.object. 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
	
	<script>
		function myFunction() {
			var title = document.title;
			var domain = document.domain;
			var body = document.body;
			document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
			"the title of the document is : "
			+ title
			+ "<br>"
			+ "domain : "
			+ domain
			+ "<br>"
			+ "body : "
			+ body;
		}
	</script>
</body>

</html>
  
  
Window Object: The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created. 

Syntax:
window.property_name;


Properties of the window:

console: It returns a reference to the console object which provides access to the browserâ€™s debugging console.
controllers: It returns the XUL controller objects for the current Chrome window.
crypto: It returns the browser crypto object.
Document: It returns a reference to the document object of that window.
History: It provides information on the URLs visited in the current window.
Length: It represents the number of frames in the current window.
Location: It contains the URL of the current window.
innerHeight: It is used to get the height of the content area of the browser window.
innerWidth: It is used to get the width of the content area of the browser window.
Name: It contains the name of the referenced window.
Window: It returns the current window or frame.
Navigator: It returns a reference to the navigator object.
outerHeight: It will get the height of the outside of the browser window.

Example: This example describes the implementation of the window.object.
  
<!DOCTYPE html>

<body>
	<script>
		function show() {
			var h = window.innerHeight;
			var w = window.innerWidth;
			var l = window.location;
			var c = window.closed;
			document.getElementById("prop").innerHTML =
			"Frame's Height: "
			+ h + "<br>"
			+ "Frame's Width: "
			+ w + "<br>"
